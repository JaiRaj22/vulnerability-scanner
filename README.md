# Vulnerability Scanner

## Introduction
This project is a web vulnerability scanner designed to identify common security issues in web applications. It checks for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Open Redirects, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and CORS misconfigurations.

## Dependencies
The application requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- Streamlit
- BeautifulSoup4
- Selenium
- requests
- webdriver-manager

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

`pip install streamlit beautifulsoup4 selenium requests webdriver-manager`


## Tools and Frameworks
- **Streamlit**: Used for creating the web interface.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Selenium**: Used for automating web browsers.
- **requests**: Used for making HTTP requests.

## Testing the Application
1. **Demo Testing**:
   - Run `demo.py` to perform initial tests and ensure the setup is correct.
   - This script should validate basic functionality and output test results.
   - Then run index.html and paste the link in main.py input field for testing the demo vulnerable web application.

2. **Live Testing**:
   - Run main.py with `python main.py` and paste the desired url for testing the mentioned vulnerabilities.
   - Before using this application to scan a URL, ensure you have the right to test the website, as unauthorized scanning can be considered illegal and unethical. Always seek permission from the website owner     
     before conducting any vulnerability scans. This tool is intended for security testing and educational purposes only.

## Vulnerabilities and Impacts
- **SQL Injection**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Allows attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- **Open Redirect**: Allows attackers to redirect users to malicious websites.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: Tricks a user into submitting a malicious request.
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**: Allows attackers to send crafted requests from the backend server.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: Misconfigurations can allow unauthorized access to API resources.

Each of these vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and other significant security risks, potentially resulting in financial and reputational damage to the business.

## Conclusion
This vulnerability scanner is a powerful tool for identifying potential security threats in web applications. Regular scanning and timely addressing of identified vulnerabilities are crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of any web-based business infrastructure.
